<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="./Pictures\placeholder-300x202.jpg" alt="Austin Ring">
<div>
My interest in the technology field began early in my life, but only starting in 2018 did I seriously consider it as a career option. 
Ever since then I have poured myself into both classroom and self study. 
I have found that both the creative and critical thinking aspects of software development combine to create a unique experience that I find compelling.

<h2>Skills</h2>
<div>
<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
Throughout the development of several applications, I have found that a function that I thought would work perfectly for what I was working on just was not a good fit. This leads me to  seek better functions or just step through the issues myself.
</div>
<div>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
 In the Nashville Software School, I had many opportunities to work with a group of three or four other students over zoom. We used both sketch board and dbbiagram.io to aid in visual representation of the application.

<h3>Holiday Road</h3>
Aug 2020-Holiday road is an itinerary built using the National Park Services api and a weather service api to get up to date weather information for a selected park. It also included two api provided by NSS, one with a list of restaurants and the other with odd attractions. The user would be able to select a park, an attraction, and a restaurant that would then be saved to the groups own api. Based on the groups chosen persona we randomly recommended locations that included tags relevant to that persona. My role in the group was to retrieve and display weather information, render the save itinerary button after all three options were selected and provide the save itinerary button its functionality.

<h3>MTG Organizer</h3>
September 2020-Magic The Gathering (MTG) Organizer is a web application completely designed and developed by me with the occasional help from an instructor. It utilizes an API that allows for text input to search and return several  objects that represent  cards in game. It then copies the object into my own json server. React then rerenders the DOM to display an image taken from the returned object and an add to collection button.  Once the user finds the current card, they can click the add to collection button to create a link between the user id and the card id. Under the users collection tab, the user can click an image of a card to display additional information, sort the cards based on color, and delete the card from their collection.
