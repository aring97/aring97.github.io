<div>
My interest in the technology field began early in my life, but only starting in 2018 did I seriously consider it as a career option. 
Ever since then I have poured myself into both classroom and self study. 
I have found that both the creative and critical thinking aspects of software development combine to create a unique experience that I find compelling.
