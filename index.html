<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="flex">
<img src="./Pictures\placeholder-300x202.jpg" alt="Austin Ring" class="left">
<div class="right">
<p>My interest in the technology field began early in my life, but only starting in 2018 did I seriously consider it as a career option. Ever since then I have poured myself into both 
    classroom and self study. I have found that both the creative and critical thinking aspects of software development combine to create a unique experience that I find interesting. 
    With this resume I seek to use my knowledge and experience in the computer industry.

This project includes the ability to add, remove, and list friends, events, tasks, and articles as well as display weather information for the current day and location.

<div>
<p>September 2020<br>Magic The Gathering (MTG) Organizer is a web application completely designed and developed by me with the occasional help from an instructor. It utilizes an API that allows for text input to search and return several  objects that represent  cards in game. It then copies the object into my own json server. React then rerenders the DOM to display an image taken from the returned object and an add to collection button.  Once the user finds the current card, they can click the add to collection button to create a link between the user id and the card id. Under the users collection tab, the user can click an image of a card to display additional information, sort the cards based on color, and delete the card from their collection. 
Tools used: HTML, CSS, React, gitHub</p>
